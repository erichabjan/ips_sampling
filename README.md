# CICY Improved Point Sampling

This repository is a code base that generates points on Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau (CICY) manifolds using the Improved Point Sampling method from [Keller-Lukic](https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1387). This repository is intended to be added to the sampling code that exists for [cymetric](https://github.com/ruehlef/cymetric).
