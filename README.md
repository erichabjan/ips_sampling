# Improved Point Sampling CICYs

This repository is a code base that generates points on Complete Intersection Calabi-Yau (CICY) manifolds using the Improved Point Sampling (IPS) method from [Keller-Lukic](https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1387). This repository is intended to be added to the sampling code that exists for `[cymetric](https://github.com/ruehlef/cymetric)`. 

In the images below, you see the current sampling ability of the `cymetric` code on the left using just a single Fubini-Study metric. On the right, you see the sampling ability of this implementation IPS. This code is a working progress.
